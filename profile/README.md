ðŸ’•Hello, it's glad to have you support us.

We are a team consists of students, making advantages of our every member's interests to build the game together with love. To reflect some negative aspects of the reality, we are working together to convey our own views towards negative emotions: how it forms, why it's difficult to get rid of.

"We are working neither for letting off our negative emotions, nor making someone happy. Instead, resonating with players and telling them there's always people around to accompany them is our main aim."

We have no plans to charge for the game itself.

The current status of our project: Early BETA.
